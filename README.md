# MicrosoftMalwareDetection
This Repository has two main codes which I wrote for analyzing the data for a Kaggle competition. The data is released by Microsoft and the challenge is to identify the malwares based on multiple features. I used logisitic regression both on tensorflow and without tensorflow, but the accuracy was low. For the second attempt I wrote an AdaBooster Tree and the accuracy increased for around 10%!
